# Eye In The Sky
Satellite Image Segmentaion, Inter-IIT Techmeet 2018, IIT Bombay.

This is code for the "Eye in The Sky" competetion in the 7th Inter-IIT Techmeet 2018 held at IIT Bombay from 18 Dec-20 Dec.
The problem was satellite image segmentaion challenge. 
Our rank was 4th among all IIT's.
Our whole project was done on google colaboratory, and as of now we haven't change the code to be run on other systems.

# Info
This repository contains the implementation of U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation modified for the problem of satellite image classification.

Decent accuracy was achieved considering the small dataset, however.The dataset included 14 high resolution images with 7 labelled classes (labelled image was given separately).

#Format of Code

We are working on cleaning it up.
